scriptc compiles TypeScript and JavaScript to native executables and WebAssembly. It uses TypeScript's type information to compile supported code to native instructions. Static builds run without Node.js or a JavaScript engine.

For npm dependencies and `any`-typed code, enable `--dynamic` to include the embedded [quickjs-ng](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs) engine. Dependency JavaScript is included at build time.

scriptc is experimental and supports a subset of JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js APIs. See the [limitations](https://scriptc.dev/docs/limitations) and [Node.js compatibility reference](https://scriptc.dev/compatibility) before using it for an existing project.

## Installation

Install with Node.js 24 or later and npm:

```console
$ npm install -g scriptc
```

The installed compiler runs natively on supported macOS, Linux, and Windows hosts. Native compilation and execution do not require Node.js. Standalone compiler archives are also available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vercel-labs/scriptc/releases).

Executable builds require a platform linker and SDK/sysroot. See the [quickstart](https://scriptc.dev/docs/quickstart) for prerequisites and [platform support](https://scriptc.dev/docs/platforms) for host requirements, cross-compilation, and WebAssembly.

## Build a program

Create `hello.ts`:

```ts
const who = process.argv.length > 2 ? process.argv[2] : "world";
console.log(`hello, ${who}`);
```

Compile and run it in one step:

```console
$ scriptc run hello.ts
hello, world
```

Or write a standalone executable:

```console
$ scriptc build hello.ts -o hello
$ ./hello scriptc
hello, scriptc
```

These examples use POSIX shell syntax. On Windows, build `hello.exe` and run it with `.\hello.exe`.

Use `scriptc coverage hello.ts` to check which operations compile statically, require dynamic execution, or are unsupported. See [coverage reports](https://scriptc.dev/docs/coverage) for details.

## Use Node APIs

Supported Node APIs compile to the native runtime. For example, `server.ts`:

```ts
import { createServer } from "node:http";

const server = createServer((req, res) => {
  res.setHeader("content-type", "application/json");
  res.end(JSON.stringify({ path: req.url }));
});

server.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log("listening on http://localhost:8080");
});
```

```console
$ scriptc build server.ts -o server
$ ./server
listening on http://localhost:8080
```

## Use npm packages

Pass `--dynamic` to embed an npm package's JavaScript in the executable. The result does not read `node_modules` at runtime.

Create `cli.ts`:

```ts
import pc from "picocolors";

console.log(pc.green("hello from scriptc"));
```

```console
$ npm install picocolors
$ scriptc build cli.ts --dynamic -o cli
$ ./cli
hello from scriptc
```

Enabling `--dynamic` does not add support for unsupported statically typed calls. See [npm dependencies](https://scriptc.dev/docs/dependencies) for package resolution and the boundary between static and dynamic code.
