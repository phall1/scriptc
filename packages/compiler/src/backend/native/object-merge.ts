/* Multi-instance library mode's localization step: combine the program
 * object with exactly the runtime/vendor members it reaches into ONE
 * relocatable object, then demote every scriptc external definition except
 * the profile-declared symbols to a local symbol. The internals are not
 * renamed apart — they stop being visible to the embedder's linker at all,
 * so a second archive built under a different prefix brings its own private
 * copy of the whole runtime (allocator, collector, arena, panic sink) into
 * the same process. Undefined references (the target C/math runtime and
 * system APIs, plus sanitizer ABI in instrumented builds) keep their global
 * binding: those platform services and the sanitizer are the embedder's,
 * shared by design. Windows embedders additionally link advapi32, iphlpapi,
 * and ws2_32.
 *
 * The generated program and optional identity objects are mandatory roots;
 * support-member selection still matters. A classic archive's unused members (and their
 * undefined references to units library mode excludes, like the
 * fs-promises unit's fiber symbols) never reach an embedder's link. A
 * blind merge of every object would carry those references into the one
 * combined member. Staging the support objects into an intermediate
 * archive keeps the linker's own member semantics: `ld -r` pulls only the
 * members the program object transitively needs (the COFF arm implements
 * the same member semantics in process).
 *
 *   Mach-O — one host-ld64 invocation: -r merges roots + needed members,
 *            -exported_symbols_list demotes every unlisted global to
 *            private extern, and -r without -keep_private_externs writes
 *            private externs out as non-external symbols. Apple ASan's
 *            image-registration COMMON remains shared so the final Mach-O
 *            image registers its globals once. ld64 reads every Apple
 *            platform's objects — macOS architectures and the iOS/
 *            iOS-simulator triples alike (LC_BUILD_VERSION platform and
 *            minos survive the merge) — so darwin-host macos AND ios
 *            targets ride the same arm; compileLibrary refuses those
 *            targets elsewhere.
 *   ELF, native linux host — ld -r merges with --force-group-allocation
 *            (ASan's instrumented globals ride ELF section groups whose
 *            signatures repeat across archives sharing runtime objects;
 *            resolving the groups into the combined member keeps a later
 *            multi-archive link from discarding one archive's copies),
 *            then binutils objcopy --keep-global-symbols localizes every
 *            other DEFINED global (objcopy leaves undefined symbols
 *            global by its own rule). The exact historical recipe.
 *   ELF, cross triples from any host — `zig cc -target <triple> -r`
 *            merges (zig is already the cross driver's hard requirement),
 *            then localizeElfObject demotes in process and resolves
 *            section groups the way --force-group-allocation does, with
 *            no host binutils/llvm-objcopy dependency.
 *   COFF, native win32 hosts and windows cross triples from any host —
 *            mergeAndLocalizeCoffObjects performs member selection, the
 *            merge, cross-object symbol resolution, and demotion in
 *            process: no linker offers a COFF relocatable mode (lld-link
 *            mirrors MSVC link.exe; zig's COFF driver refuses multi-object
 *            merges) and llvm-objcopy rejects symbol-scope flags for
 *            COFF, so no tool pairing exists to shell out to. */
